# CP1404/5632 Assignment: Reading List by Vihangi Vagal


> The project reflection is complete and describes development and learning well, shows careful thought, highlights insights made during code development.


## 1. How long did the entire project (assignment 2) take you?
 The entire project took me 4 days with 3-4 hours each day. It took me 15 hours to complete the whole project

## 2. What are you most satisfied with?
 I am satisfied that I am well-versed with kivy and python. I cracked the code without any help. I was also able to implement the
 Knowledge that I am gained from the lectures.It was like a preperation for the exams.

## 3. What are you least satisfied with?
I am not satisfied with how we were specified with the functions we had to make in each class. This stops my creativity .

## 4. What worked well in your development process?
I was able to design the classes and call each other with not much effort. Conncecting the kivy and the main file wasn;t very difficult
either . The kivy demo files on the github were very helpful while making the project.

## 5. What about your process could be improved the next time you do a project like this?
I could be more organised in terms of code and probably understand and crack the code faster. I feel I spend a lot of time on this
assignment

## 6. Describe what resources you used and how you used them.
I used the github repositiry uploaded by our lecturer which contained the codes performed during the lecture. It was very useful as
I could inherit solutions for my code. Moreover, the kivy demo files git was equally helpful while connecting the main file and kivy file.
Moreover the lecture slides helped me better understand the code. I also reffered to online sites to determine how to assign a color to
the button for color coding. I also accessed the different color code from the internet.

## 7. Describe the main challenges or obstacles you faced and how you overcame them.
The main obstacle was to mark a book as completed . I tried different methods and finally used the function search by title to
 search the book details and then passed that into mark_book function where it was marked completed. I also was intially stuck on
 loading the required list and completed list onto the kivy file. I used the demo codes and lecture codes uploaded on git to find a solution.
 I also found it difficult to understand the structure and function of the classes. But our lecturer was really helpful and explained us
 how we could solve that problem. These were the only problems I faced.
